# IAM AssumeRole with STS – Phase 1 Lab 3 (Free-Tier Safe)

## Objective
The objective of this lab was to implement secure, role-based access using AWS STS AssumeRole.  
An IAM user was configured to temporarily assume an IAM role, eliminating the need for broad or long-term permissions and preparing the environment for Terraform and automation workflows.

---

## Why This Lab Is Important
- Avoids using long-term credentials for privileged access
- Implements enterprise-grade authentication without IAM Identity Center
- Fully compatible with AWS Free Tier
- Mirrors real-world DevOps and CI/CD authentication patterns
