## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository follows a **structured AWS Cloud Learning Pathway** designed to build **production-ready cloud skills** from the ground up.  
Each phase focuses on a core AWS domain and includes:

- ✅ Standalone, hands-on labs  
- ✅ Terraform-based Infrastructure as Code  
- ✅ AWS Free Tier–only resources  
- ✅ Security and least-privilege by default  
- ✅ Git checkpoints for documentation and version control  

Every lab is treated like a **real engineering task**, not a demo.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

- **Learn by building**
- **Automate everything**
- **Security is not optional**
- **Document like a professional**
- **Ship small, but ship real**

This repo is not just for learning — it’s meant to be **shown on your CV, GitHub, and LinkedIn**.
